## Ab Initio
In the [geneID](abInitio/genes/geneIdGene1.fa) we catche 1 gene and 13 exons, with the [FGENESH](anInitio/FGENESH.fa) we catch 2 genes and 15 exons and finally with the [GENESCAN](abInitio/GENESCAN.fa) with 2 genes.

We have determined that FGENESH and GENESCAN that have 2 genes we catch the more centric of the 2 to comaprate becaus the other ones are situated in oposite extremes.
